## **Requirements**

### **1. Structural Design (HTML):**

  - A `<header>` containing the website logo or project title.
  - A `<nav>` for navigation between sections/pages.
  - A `<main>` element for the main content of the page.
  - A `<footer>` element with relevant information (e.g., copyright or contact details).
- Utilize semantic HTML tags such as `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>` where appropriate.
- Include a form with the following fields:
  - A text input (e.g., name or email).
  - A dropdown menu or radio buttons for selection.
  - A submit button.

### **2. Styling and Layout (CSS):**
- Use **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** to arrange and align content.
- Define custom styles with **CSS Variables** for colors and fonts.
- Add **hover effects** to buttons and menus for interactivity.
- Incorporate at least one image as a background or design element using **background properties**.

### **5. Optional Add-Ons (Bonus Points):**
